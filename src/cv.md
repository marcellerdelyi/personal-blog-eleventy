## About

I'm a visualization engineer with over 4 years of experience, specializing in technical animations and detailed product renderings for large-scale offshore platforms. My main focus is assembly animations and digital product renderings ,but I'm also interested in game development and scripting. I'm creating products that are used in both engineering and marketing. Beyond my core responsibility, I'm also involved with post production works on films, handling tasks such as colour correction of footage and creating simple graphic elements.

## Work Experience
---

**AkerSolutions - Visualization Engineer**  
_Verdal, Trøndelag, Norway_  
Sep 2021 – Present

Over the years, I’ve delivered various product assembly animations and digital renderings for both internal engineering teams and external promotional purposes. Many of these visuals are for projects that are either currently under construction or already deployed across major North Sea fields such as Jackdaw, Yggdrasil, and East Anglia, to name a few.

I’ve also played a role in setting up a collaborative development environment using Perforce version control. This included configuring servers on both Linux and Windows, and later deploying the production server with additional tools to support internal team workflows.

As part of an Unreal Engine–based planning application, I assisted in developing the animation pipeline for handling rigs and 3D assets. I created all the rigs, animations and prepared environmental assets including cranes, buildings, and other smaller elements

I helped establish a working pipeline between Unreal Engine and DaVinci Resolve to aid post-production work related to editing and colour grading.

I continue to be actively involved in post-production for film-related projects, focusing primarily on colour correction for both internal presentations and external communication materials.

Additionally, I’ve contributed to technical documentation to help standardize and document visualization workflows across the team.

I also spent several months working closely with the internal engineering department to prepare CAD models for fabrication, using tools like AutoCAD and Navisworks.

To improve efficiency, I write smaller scripts to automate parts of my own workflow.

**AkerSolutions - Summer Internship**  
_Verdal, Trøndelag, Norway_  
Jun 2021 – Aug 2021

During my summer internship at Aker Solutions,  I primarily focused on asset preparation, rigging, and creating animations for a promotional video highlighting the company's new high-tech robotic facility, the Verdal Production Line (VPL). The VPL project is one of the largest development in the company’s history.

**AkerSolutions - School Internship**  
_Verdal, Trøndelag, Norway_  
Jan 2021 – May 2021

I was part of Nord University's school internship program, which allowed me to spend several months gaining on-site experience at the company. During this period, I learned rigging and animation within Unreal Engine with a primarily focus on researching and prototyping procedural animations. The program resulted in an offer to continue as a summer intern after I finished my studies.

**Nord University - Teacher Assistant**  
_Levanger, Trøndelag, Norway_  
Sep 2020 – Dec 2020

Taught design and graphics for the first-year Film and TV course, delivering weekly lessons to approximately 20 students throughout the first semester.

**Smart Media - Summer Internship**  
_Steinkjer, Trøndelag, Norway_  
Apr 2019 – Jul 2019  

I spent several months as a school intern at Smartmedia, a local company in Steinkjer specializing in marketing, strategy, design, and web development. During my time there, I gained hands-on experience designing and developing websites, exploring how to deliver digital products and content using framework models such as the Core Model ("Kjernemodellen"). Additionally, I was given an independent project to design and prototype an interactive floor plan using Unity.
