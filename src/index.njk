<h1> Hei, I'm Marcell! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>I'm a Budapest born hungarian, now living in the heart of Norway. I currently work as a visualization engineer at <a href="https://www.akersolutions.com/">AkerSolutions</a>.
I'm a nerd with many hobbies and interests. This website is my latest personal project where I share a bit about myself.</p>
