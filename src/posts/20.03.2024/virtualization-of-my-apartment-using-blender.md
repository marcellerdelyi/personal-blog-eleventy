A few months ago, I wanted to review my apartment's layout in preparation for potential future renovations. To my surprise, I discovered that no official drawings existed. My apartment, built in the 1950s and renovated around 2005-2007, lacked any construction or renovation documentation. After speaking with a neighbour, I learned that the building was originally a local convenience store, and the only existing plan was an outdated one drawn by a now deceased architect. Faced with this challenge, I decided to create my own floor plan using Blender.

# Project Overview

To start, I needed a few essential tools. First, I required a way to measure the dimensions of my apartment accurately. Then, I needed software to translate that data into a 3D environment, where I could build a virtual model of the apartment and generate a floor plan.

A collegue recommended using Scaniverse, a 3D scanning application available for Iphone and Ipad users. This app can perform 3D scans with enough accuracy for my project. Although I don't own either of these devices, I was fortunate to have access to an iPad that I could borrow for scanning.

For designing the floor plan and visualizing tne model, I chose Blender. Blender is an open-source software primarly used for creating 3D models, anmimations, simulations, rendering and more. I selected Blender because it's a tool I'm most familiar with. Additionally, Blender has an addon called Bonsai formerly known as BlenderBim, an open-source Building Information Modeling (BIM) tool widely used in construction and architecture.
Bonsai offers features that make creating floor plans relatively straightforward. Unlike typical 3D models, BIM data doesnâ€™t require geometry, which could be a limitation for this project, but I guess I'll find out as I progress. If necessary, I may explore alternative open-source options like FreeCAD or LibreCAD, though I have limited experience with these tools.

# Final Thoughts

In the upcoming parts of this blog series, I'll dive deeper into each step of the process from scanning the apartment to refining the 3D model in Blender, and finally, generating a detailed floor plan.
